        <h1>Tests for Voicing Equation Systems</h1>
        This is part of a <a href="http://diagramcenter.org/">Diagram Center</a> Project.
        <h2>Multiline Equations</h1>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="equ0.html">MathSpeak</a></li>

              This is the regular MathSpeak rendering with standard walking of
              the expression.
              
          <li><a href="equ1.html">Simplified speech</a></li>

              This drastically simplifies the speech output for the overall
              table, omitting much of the layout announcements of MathSpeak.
              
          <li><a href="equ2.html">Mathspeak with initial component repeated</a></li>

              This simply repeats the omitted first element in the first column
              (indicated by a thus). The actual voicing can be ameliorated, but
              the main question is: <b>Is that useful at all?</b>
              
          <li><a href="equ3.html">MathSpeak and Table Walker</a></li>

              In Table walker mode, shift arrow keys allows to walk vertically
              and horizontally on the single cells of a table.  Currently the
              speech on the cells is the same as in regular walking
              mode. However there are a couple of questions regarding this.

              <p>
              <b>Points of interest:</b> Is the walker useful at all?

              <p>
              Currently only the column number is announced when walking on
              cells. But Would it be useful to announce the full coordinates of
              the next position (i.e row and column), or no coordinates at all?
              
        </ol>
        <h2>Multiline Equations with Labels</h1><p>
        All examples are with Mathspeak. Style is either Verbose, Brief or SuperBrief, as indicated.
        <ol>
          <li><a href="eqlab0.html">Verbose Label</a></li>

              Verbose label that announces it's start and end.

          <li><a href="eqlab1.html">Brief Label</a></li>

              Brief label that announces it's start only. Since the start of the
              row with it's number is announced anyway, this might be
              sufficient.

          <li><a href="eqlab2.html">Super Brief Label</a></li>

              Superbrief label that announces it's start only and omits as much
              as possible parenthesis.
              
              <p>Note that labels can not explicitly explored. It would be
              interesting to see if the testers express a desire to explore
              labels. In particular, in the last of the four examples it might
              be helpful for the reader to go through details.

        </ol>
        <h2>Multiline Formulas with Labels</h1>
        All examples are with Mathspeak. Style is either Verbose, Brief or SuperBrief, as indicated.
